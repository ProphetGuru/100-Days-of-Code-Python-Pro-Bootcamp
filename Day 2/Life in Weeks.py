# 
# Instructions
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# 
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
# 
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
# 
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
# 
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
# 
# Example Input: 56
# Example Output: You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
# 
# Hint
# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
# Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘† #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# =============================================================================


age_as_integer = int(age)
remaining_years  = 90-age_as_integer # result should be 90 - current age in years
remaining_months = remaining_years*12 # 12 months in a year
remaining_weeks = remaining_years*52 # 52 weeks in a year
remaining_days = remaining_years*365 # 365 days in a year

print(f"You have {remaining_months} months, or {remaining_weeks} weeks, or {remaining_days} days left")
